# Keyboard Heatmap
This repository contains the sourcecode of [my recently released keyboard heatmap](http://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/ "Realtime Keyboard Heatmap").
The keyboard heatmap shows the distribution of characters of a text while you're typing. It's using my JavaScript heatmap library ([heatmap.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/ "Heatmap.js")) to make that possible.

Currently support keyboard layouts:
- ASSET
- CARPALX_QFMLWY
- QWERTY
- DVORAK
- DVORAK PROGRAMMER
- COLEMAK
- LIIGOL
- ERGODOX COLEMAK/DVORAK/QWERTY
- MicroTRON QWERTY
- MINIMAK 4/8/12 K
- NORMAN
- WORKMAN


**Contributions are very welcome!**
